# tidytuesday

This repository is used to gather the code and products I'm generating for the weekly [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=typed_query) event, organized by the [R4DS community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Each week, a dataset is selected by the organizers, and the community works to build skills in data-wrangling and data visualization/presentation. Tools within the `{tidyverse}` ecosystem (such as `{ggplot2}` and `{dplyr}`) are emphasized.
