# tidytuesday

This repository is used to gather the code and products I'm generating for the weekly [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=typed_query) event, organized by the [R4DS community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Each week, a dataset is selected by the organizers, and the community works to build skills in data-wrangling and data visualization/presentation. Tools within the `{tidyverse}` ecosystem (such as `{ggplot2}` and `{dplyr}`) are emphasized.

### Week 35, DLC Lemurs

![Life tables for groups of wild-born vs. captive-born lemurs housed by the Duke Lemur Center. Kaplan-Meier probabilities for each group are shown at years 0-40 in 5-year increments. The life-table data can be found here: https://github.com/ndrewwm/tidytuesday/blob/main/2021/week35-dlc-lemurs/20210824-dlc-lemurs-lifetables.csv. The source data can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-08-24/readme.md

### Week 33, BEA Infrastructure

![A line plot tracking investment in health infrastructure, with 4 different series: health overall, private equipment, private hospitals, other health structures, and all federal. The plot has the following title: "Real investment in health infrastructure, 1947-2017", and subtitle: "Spending on equipment (e.g., electromedical machinery & instruments) has increased drastically since 1995, partially due to corresponding declines in prices." The x-axis marks decades from 1950 to 2010, and the y-axis measures chained 2012 dollars in millions (ranging from $500M to $150,000M). The series show that overall investment has been increasing steadily, driven largely by spending on private equipment. Spending on private equipment overtook investment in structures (e.g. hospitals, clinics) in the early 90s; investments in structures have been increasing much more slowly. As of 2017, overall investment is above $150,000M, investment in private equipment is around $128,000M. Federal spending is consistently the smallest of the series at each time point, usually close to the $500M mark.](https://github.com/ndrewwm/tidytuesday/blob/main/2021/week33-bea-infrastructure/20210810-bea-health-care-investment.png)

### Week 31, Olympic Athletes

![A faceted line-plot, plotting the standard deviation (SD) of age height (cm), and weight (kg) for male & female Olympic athletes from 1896-2016. The plot is titled: "Modern Olympic athletes tend to be of similar age, but vary in build." Each of the 6 plot facets are dedicated to one variable/sex combination. Summer and winter games are tracked as separate lines within each panel, with winter games colored darker. For both male and female athletes, the SD for age peaked between 1920 and 1950, and has decreased to below 6 years as of 2016. The SDs for height and weight have been increasing in both male/female athletes competing in summer games since 1950. In winter games, the SD for height has remained relatively flat at 6cm, but the SD for weight has risen for both male/female athletes. Between 1960 to 2014, the SD for male athletes in the winter games has risen from 8kg to 12kg, compared to an increase from 6kg to 8kg in female athletes.](https://github.com/ndrewwm/tidytuesday/blob/main/2021/week31-olympic-medals/20210727-kaggle-olympics.png)

### Week 30, US Drought Monitor Data

![This plot is a set of 9 heatmaps, dedicated to Western US states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. The timelines show weekly estimates from January 2015 to July 2021. Percentages are calculated for each week to indicate the share of people living in an area experiencing drought conditions between "Moderate" and "Exceptional". In Nevada and Utah, a cyclical pattern is observable, with over 80% of the population experiencing drought conditions roughly every 3 years, usually for at least 6 months at a time. Aside from Wyoming and Colorado, between 50%-90% of each state's population was experiencing some degree of drought during the entire summer 2015 and mid-2016. Notably, upwards of 70% residents in Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, and Oregon have experienced drought conditions for approximately 9 of the past 12 months. Currently, 5 of the 9 states have over 95% of their residents living in drought conditions.](https://github.com/ndrewwm/tidytuesday/blob/main/2021/week30-drought-monitor/20210720-us-drought-monitor-heatmaps.png)
