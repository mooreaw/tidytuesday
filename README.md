# tidytuesday

This repository is used to gather the code and products I'm generating for the weekly [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=typed_query) event, organized by the [R4DS community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Each week, a dataset is selected by the organizers, and the community works to build skills in data-wrangling and data visualization/presentation. Tools within the `{tidyverse}` ecosystem (such as `{ggplot2}` and `{dplyr}`) are emphasized.

### Week 30, US Drought Monitor Data

![This plot is a set of 9 heatmaps, dedicated to Western US states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. The timelines show weekly estimates from January 2015 to July 2021. Percentages are calculated for each week to indicate the share of people living in an area experiencing drought conditions between "Moderate" and "Exceptional". In Nevada and Utah, a cyclical pattern is observable, with over 80% of the population experiencing drought conditions roughly every 3 years, usually for at least 6 months at a time. Aside from Wyoming and Colorado, between 50%-90% of each state's population was experiencing some degree of drought during the entire summer 2015 and mid-2016. Notably, upwards of 70% residents in Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, and Oregon have experienced drought conditions for approximately 9 of the past 12 months. Currently, 5 of the 9 states have over 95% of their residents living in drought conditions.](https://github.com/mooreaw/tidytuesday/blob/main/2021/week30-drought-monitor/20210720-us-drought-monitor-heatmaps.png)
